# Benchmarking (of Software Systems)
<standard name="Benchmarking (of Software Systems)">

*In empirical software engineering research, benchmarking can be used for comparing different methods, techniques, and tools for developing software systems.*

## Application 

This standard applies to empirical research that meets the following conditions.

-   investigates software systems within a defined context with an automated, repeatable procedure
-   studies the software system’s quality of service under a specific workload
-   compares different artifacts that are the result of applying the **Engineering Research (AKA Design Science) Standard**

If the benchmark experiments primarily study software systems, use this standard. 
For experiments with human participants, see the **Experiments (with Human Participants) Standard**.
For simulation of models of the software systems, see the **Simulation (Quantitative) Standard**.
If the study is conducted within a real-world context, see the **Case Study and Ethnography Standard**.


## Specific Attributes
### Essential Attributes
<checklist name="Essential">

- [ ]   justifies the relevance of the benchmark
- [ ]   describes the experimental setup for the benchmark with sufficient detail
- [ ]   specifies the workload with sufficient detail
- [ ]   uses a standard benchmark or provides all details necessary for turning it into a standard benchmark, including making the benchmark tools available as open source
- [ ]   allows different configurations of a system under test to compete on their merits without artificial limitations
- [ ]   provides confidence that a benchmark result is accurate
- [ ]   draws statistically grounded conclusions, e.g., by means of appropriate statistical methods, sufficiently long execution duration and sufficient number of experiment repetitions
- [ ]   avoids roadblocks for users to run the benchmark in their test environments
- [ ]   provides a replication package including datasets and analysis scripts (for the **Engineering Research (AKA Design Science) Standard** this a desirable attribute, for benchmarks this is an essential attribute)

</checklist>
    
### Desirable Attributes
<checklist name="Desirable">
    
- [ ]	reports on independent replication of the benchmark results
- [ ]	reports on a large community that uses the benchmark
- [ ]	reports on an independent organization that maintains the benchmark.

</checklist>
    
### Extraordinary Attributes

## General Quality Criteria 

Fairness of measurements, reproducibility of results across experiment repetitions, benchmarking the *right* aspects, using a realistic benchmark with a representative workload

## Examples of Acceptable Deviations 

-   The article reports on problems with executing benchmark runs.

## Antipatterns 

-   Tailoring benchmarks toward a specific method, technique or tool, which is evaluated with the benchmark.
-   Using benchmarking experiments that are irrelevant for the problem studied to obfuscate weaknesses in the proposed approach
-   Running a benchmark experiment only once
-   Not running a benchmark experiment for a sufficiently long duration
-   Collecting aggregated measurements instead of persisting all raw results and running an offline analysis

## Invalid Criticisms 

-   There is no large community using the benchmark. It should be sufficient to start the development process of a new benchmark with a small group of researchers as an offer to a larger scientific community. Such a proto-benchmark<footnote><sup>[1](#myfootnote1)</sup> can act as a template to further the discussion of the topic and to initialize the consensus process.
-   No independent replication of the benchmark results is reported.
-   There is no independent organization that maintains the benchmark.
